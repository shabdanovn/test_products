# Getting Started with Create React App

This is a simple test project that shows list of products, where user can filter them by categories and search by name. Also, it is possible to mark products as favorites then sort favorite products out. 
I have used Context API for global state controlling, used hooks, and FSD architecture. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
